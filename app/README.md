Money Balancer
=================================================
[Nodejs and html, bootstrap, css, jquery]
To extend my understanding and learning of Nodejs,jQuery, I developed a small web application which helps to handle expenses. It is not a complete functioning
project, some very basic functionalities have been implemented as an initiative to understand hasura Apis.I have implemented backend of my project using hasura auth and data apis.

I would be working more to make the project efficient and nicer and complete as and when time permits.

To use this application just run
```
cd MB_Project 

npm start
```
